# Object Oriented Programming in Pyton 3.
As I am reading the book and working through the examples, I take the liberty of modifying the code as I fancy.
The goal of the changes is to learn by modifying the given example. 
The changes are not because I feel an example is inadequate for any reason.

# Differences from the book
This section provides some details about the changes that I made to the examples given in the book.
The list below is in alphabetical order of the topic, and not in the order of implementation.
