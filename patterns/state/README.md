A simple XML parser that builds a tree of nodes corresponding to tags.

Handles only the tags and tag names, and does not handle tag attributes.

Does not parse mixed content, which has tags inside of text.

Note that this code is assuming a valid input file.

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate the state pattern.
